        <p className="text-lg">We are three software engineering fellows who are passionate about leveraging technology to empower communities. Our website was born out of a shared vision to help people make informed decisions when they move and stay connected with their neighborhoods. We understand the challenges of relocating and the importance of feeling at home in a new area. That's why we created this platformâ€”to provide valuable information and foster a sense of community. We believe that by combining our technical skills with our desire to make a positive impact, we can help individuals and families navigate the moving process with confidence and stay up to date with events and developments in their neighborhoods.</p>

          Moving can be a very difficult and tedious process. Our website aims
          to make this process easier by providing specifics and valuable
          information about the neighborhood. This information includes median
          household income, neighborhood population, and more. It is important
          to feel safe and comfortable in your surroundings, which is why we
          also offer a community forum. You can discuss anything from events to
          concerns to suggestions. We want to empower you with making informed
          decisions.
