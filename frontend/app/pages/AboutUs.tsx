        We are three software engineering fellows who are passionate about
        leveraging technology to empower communities. Our website was born out
        of a shared vision to help people make informed decisions when they move
        and stay connected with their neighborhoods. We understand the
        challenges of relocating and the importance of feeling at home in a new
        area. That's why we created this platformâ€”to provide valuable
        information and foster a sense of community. We believe that by
        combining our technical skills with our desire to make a positive
        impact, we can help individuals and families navigate the moving process
        with confidence and stay up to date with events and developments in
        their neighborhoods.
